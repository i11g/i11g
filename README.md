### Hi I'm Ivan GeorgievðŸ‘‹
As an enthusiastic learner, Iâ€™m currently studying Front - End Test Automation as a last step of my QA Automation journey! My current focus lies in fields of Web Development and JavaScript. By becoming familiar with Web Development principles, I aim to build efficient test automation solutions, or who knows, maybe one day even develop good web applications.  
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project or topic related to Test Automation.
